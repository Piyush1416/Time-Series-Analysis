# Time-Series-Analysis
I will be demonstrating how we can forecast, using Time Series Analysis


Forecasting future can assist analysts and management in making better calculated decisions to maximise returns and minimise risks. I will be demonstrating how we can forecast exchange rates using statistical and machine learning (ML) models in Python.

I will be using  ARIMA model in StatsModels package for forecasting. 

The ARIMA model has 3 parameters:
P — Auto regressive feature of the model

D — Differencing order

Q — Moving average feature of the model
